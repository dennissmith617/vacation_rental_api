Vacation Home Rental API Program

Summary:
This Program serves as a prototype for a Vacation Home Rental API. It will allow customers to reserve homes of a given type at a desired date and time for a given number of days. Customers will be able to reserve a single home for multiple, non-overlapping time frames.

Testing is included in this program to show the functionality of the API.


Pre-program Installations/Downloads
1. Install Python3 by following the steps available at this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. You will need Python 3.7 or newer to properly run this program. Enter "python --version" in your terminal to confirm you are running a supported version. 
3. Check that Pip is installed by entering "pip --version" in your terminal.
4. If Pip is not installed, follow this link for the installation process: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
5. If you do not have Flask installed, enter "pip install Flask" into your terminal.
6. Install Pipenv by entering "pip install pipenv" in your terminal. Pipenv will serve as a dependency manager which isolates projects in private environments. We will therefore be able to install packages per project by using this.
7. Install marshmallow by entering "pip install -U marshmallow". This is a framework-agnostic library which will help us convert complex datatypes (i.e. objects) to and from Python datatypes.
